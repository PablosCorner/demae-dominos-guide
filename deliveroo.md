> Food Channel (Deliveroo) currently is only available in **select** EU countries where Deliveroo operates in. More services and regions are being looked at and considered in the future. If you're outside those select EU, use **Food Channel (Standard)** or **Food Channel (Domino's)** instead.

> As Food Channel (Deliveroo) just released, this guide is still a work in progress and will most likely be updated/changed a lot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the [WiiLink Discord](https://discord.gg/WiiLink).

I've written this temporary guide to help people properly install Food Channel (Deliveroo) from the WiiLink Patcher, as one doesn't exist on **wii.guide** yet.

#### What you need

* An SD card or USB drive
* A Wii console with an active internet connection
* A computer with an active internet connection
* A Discord account
* A Deliveroo account
* [WiiLink Patcher](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/releases)
* [Deliveroo Helper](https://github.com/WiiLink24/DeliverooHelper/releases)

##### Section I - Getting Started

1. Make sure to download the version of the WiiLink Patcher that corresponds to your operating system.
2. Launch the patcher and begin the setup process.
3. When you see the setup screen, select `1. English Translation` in order to gain access to the Food Delivery Channel (Deliveroo) channel.<br><br>

4. Next, you’ll see this screen, asking which version of Food Delivery Channel you want, so you’ll want to pick `3. Deliveroo (Select EU countries only)`<br><br>

5. After that, you can go through the rest of the process, but once you reach this step, be sure to pick the correct console platform you’re installing this on, as it will matter when using the app.<br><br>

> If you're installing this on Dolphin Emulator, please be aware that Food Channel (Deliveroo) will not work on the default Dolphin NAND, you will **need** to dump a NAND from your real Wii console. Then you can install your NAND on Dolphin by going to<br>`Tools => Manage NAND => Import BootMii NAND Backup`.

##### Section II - Registering your Console ID

1. After completing the setup process, turn on your Wii and launch the Homebrew Channel.
2. Use the `Get Console ID` Homebrew app, that was given by the patcher, to retrieve your system's console ID.
3. Save the console ID for the next section, as you will need it.

##### Section III - Setting up Deliveroo

1. Get the Deliveroo app on your phone via the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deliveroo-food-delivery-app/id1001501844) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deliveroo.orderapp).
2. Create an account and add your address and payment information.
3. Give your address a label named `demae` (all lowercase).<br><br>

4. Download the Deliveroo Helper to link your account with WiiLink, so you can order food from Deliveroo directly from Food Delivery Channel. You can download the helper from [here](https://github.com/WiiLink24/DeliverooHelper/releases).
5. Launch the Deliveroo Helper and follow the instructions on the screen.<br><br>

6. Add your console ID, from earlier, when prompted, as this will link your console with your Deliveroo account.
7. When prompted, you'll also be asked to enter your Discord ID, which you can find by going to `Settings => Advanced => Developer Mode` and enabling it. Then, right click your name and click `Copy ID`.


##### Section IV - Installing WADs

You will now install the Food Delivery Channel and Set Personal Data channels.

1. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
2. After registering your console ID, go to the Homebrew Channel and launch **Wii Mod Lite**.
3. In the WAD Manager menu, locate `Food Channel (Domino's) (English).wad`.
4. Also locate `WiiLink_SPD (Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD (vWii).wad`, depending on your console platform.
5. Select both WADs by pressing `+` on each one.
6. Press `A` to install the selected WADs.

> If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Food Channel (Domino's) (English).wad`, uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.

##### Section V - Setting up your Address Information

>You are responsible for entering your correct address information. Failure to do so may result in orders not succeeding.

In this section you will be setting your address information. This is required for proper usage of Food Delivery Channel (Deliveroo).

1. Launch the Food Delivery Channel from the Wii Menu.
2. If you have not previously set your address information, a prompt telling you to set it will appear. Press the `Address Info` button. Otherwise, click the `Change Address Information` button in the main menu.
3. Now you are in the Address Information menu. Press the arrows to traverse screens. Here you will enter your data. When you are finished, click the `Done` button and then `Demae`.<br><br>
